# Mac

### System

I like the versatility of the Mac OS X knowing that is Unix under the covers. With that in mind, I do not like bash and I instead use zsh instead. I normally setup zsh using Oh My Zsh to manage the configuration of my shell envionment. [click here to downlaod](http://ohmyz.sh/)

### Homebrew

Homebrew is the response to the need of a package manager for Mac OS X. It is an invaluable application to have if you are serious about any development using a Mac Machine.

To install it run:

``` /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" ```
